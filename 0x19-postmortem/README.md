## Impact:

The MySQL replication setup between the primary server (web-01) and the replica server (web-02) encountered a disruption, leading to data inconsistencies and impacting around 10% of users who experienced delayed or incorrect responses.
                                        
## Root cause

The root cause of the replication outage was traced back to an incorrect value used for the `MASTER_LOG_POS` parameter during the replica server's configuration.

- **09:00:** Users reported discrepancies in their data, prompting the team to investigate.

- **09:15:** Initial investigation revealed that the replica server's data was not up-to-date with the primary server's data.

- **09:30:** A hypothesis was made that the replication process might have encountered a transient glitch, and an attempt to restart the replication was made.

- **10:00:** After the restart, data inconsistencies persisted, indicating a more complex issue.

- **10:15:** A thorough examination of the replica's configuration settings revealed that the `MASTER_LOG_POS` value used during the replica server setup did not match the actual binary log position on the primary server.

- **10:30:** A decision was made to halt the replication process and rectify the `MASTER_LOG_POS` mismatch on the replica server.

- **11:00:** After updating the `MASTER_LOG_POS` value to the correct position, replication was restarted on the replica server.

- **11:30:** As replication caught up, data inconsistencies gradually diminished, and the replica was fully synchronized with the primary server's data.


## Root Cause and Resolution:

The root cause was the utilization of an erroneous `MASTER_LOG_POS` value during the replica server's configuration on `web-02`. This discrepancy led to data inconsistencies between the two servers.

To address the issue, the correct `MASTER_LOG_POS` value was obtained from the primary server's `SHOW MASTER STATUS;` output. The replica's configuration was amended with the accurate `MASTER_LOG_POS` value, and the replication process was restarted. Subsequently, the replica server began to catch up with the primary server, resolving data discrepancies.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures:

-
1. **Double-Check Configuration:** Institute a process to cross-verify replication configuration parameters before initializing the replication process.

2. **Automation and Documentation:** Develop automated scripts for replication setup to minimize manual error and maintain up-to-date configuration documentation.

3. **Regular Testing:** Implement a routine testing schedule for replication and monitoring, emphasizing the prompt identification of data inconsistencies.

4. **Automated Alerts:** Configure automated alerts to promptly notify relevant personnel in case of replication delays or discrepancies.

5. **Team Training:** Arrange training sessions to reinforce best practices in MySQL replication setup and maintenance.
